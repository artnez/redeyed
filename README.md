## Status

Nothing useful here yet, so proceed as follows:

```javascript
if (youLikeTheIdea) star(); // this will encourage me to focus more effort on this project
moveOn();
```

## What?

Takes a JavaScript abstract syntax tree, along with a config and returns the original code with words wrapped as configured.

## What for?

One usecase is adding metadata to your code that can then be used to apply syntax highlighting.
